A Hierarchical Ordered Planner for Lisp Flavored Erlang

Yes, this is Artificial Intelligence. The AI Winter is over. Lisp has
survived, and in fact, will probably never die. Get over it.


Introduction
============

Hierarchical ordered planners are part of what is called
"automated planning systems" in AI. The University of Maryland has
sponsored/created several hierarchical ordered planners and has the
following information on their site:

* `The UMD SHOP Project`_
* SourceForge links to `SHOP, JSHOP, SHOP2, and JSHOP2`_ downloads
* Bitbucket link to `pyhop`_, a Python implementation

lfe-hop aims to provide an implementation in LFE for use in Erlang projects.
In addition to the efforts linked above, lfe-hop borrows heavily from
`Peter Norvig`_'s famous Lisp AI tour de force `PAIP`_.

Though inspired by the work at UMD, lfe-hop is not affiliated with
that institution.


Further Information
-------------------

* `Lecture notes & slides`_ for an `automated planning course`_ taught at UMD
* `Automated planning and scheduling`_ on Wikipedia
* `Hierarchical task networks`_ on Wikipedia


Dependencies
------------

This project assumes that you have `rebar`_ installed somwhere in your
``$PATH``.

This project depends upon the following, which installed to the ``deps``
directory of this project when you run ``make deps``:

* `LFE`_ (Lisp Flavored Erlang; needed only to compile)
* `lfeunit`_ (needed only to run the unit tests)
